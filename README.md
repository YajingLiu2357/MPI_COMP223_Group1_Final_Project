# MPI_COMP223_Group1_Final_Project
## Introduction
    With the development of electric car, people are increasingly demanding the convenience of electric vehicle charging. 
    And Macao government also pay attention on this field. Thus, to improve Macao’s electric vehicle charging service, 
    we develop a WeChat mini program based on the WeChat applet development platform, which aims to provide a better 
    solution for working in with the facilities for electric vehicles in current social conditions.
## Developing Model
    First of all, we analyze the characteristics of our facing market. To be more specifically, our main users are Macao’s 
    individual owners of electric cars. It is a market that need to be paid close attention on customers. Moreover, the 
    market is competitive since there are many competitors who can do the similar products using the simple WeChat applet 
    development platform. Last but not least, since the electric car are just spread in Macao, the environment always has 
    dramatic changes.
    
    To response the market more appropriately, we choose to use Agile to develop our Mini program. We have the following 
    reasons. Firstly, the Agile way can help us to accelerate product delivery, which can make software in a faster 
    release cycle for quickly launching to catch the customers. Secondly, it improves the project visibility, which means 
    that it improves the ability to quickly adapt for needed changes. Finally, it helps intrinsically reduce risk in 
    developing our software.
