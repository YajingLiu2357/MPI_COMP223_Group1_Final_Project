# MPI_COMP223_Group1_Final_Project
## Introduction
With the development of electric car, people are increasingly demanding the convenience of electric vehicle charging. And Macao government also pay attention on this field. Thus, to improve Macao’s electric vehicle charging service, we develop a WeChat mini program based on the WeChat applet development platform, which aims to provide a better solution for working in with the facilities for electric vehicles in current social conditions.
## Developing Model
    First of all, we analyze the characteristics of our facing market. To be more specifically, our main users are Macao’s 
    individual owners of electric cars. It is a market that need to be paid close attention on customers. Moreover, the 
    market is competitive since there are many competitors who can do the similar products using the simple WeChat applet 
    development platform. Last but not least, since the electric car are just spread in Macao, the environment always has 
    dramatic changes.
    
    To response the market more appropriately, we choose to use Agile to develop our Mini program. We have the following 
    reasons. Firstly, the Agile way can help us to accelerate product delivery, which can make software in a faster 
    release cycle for quickly launching to catch the customers. Secondly, it improves the project visibility, which means 
    that it improves the ability to quickly adapt for needed changes. Finally, it helps intrinsically reduce risk in 
    developing our software.
## Development Plan
### Development Process
    Although the borderlines between different stages in our developing process are nor so clear, our process basically consists of following three parts.
#### Part1 Planning
    First, we make some analysis for environment of market and summarize the features of market. Besides, according to our conclusions of analyzing market, we discuss and specify three fundamental functions of our Mini program: 
    1.	Provide users Login interface and Setup function.
    2.	Provide the nearest navigation service of changing pile corresponding occupancy stats of the changing pile.
    3.	Display real-time charging status query (quantity, remaining charging time) and completion of charging prompt
#### Part2 Implementation and Module Test
    Based on the previous mentioned main functions, we divide our program into three different modules and distribute these modules to different developers for independent and parallel development. After implementation, we run individual module test to ensure that our modules can be normal and effective operation. And we release some beta versions.
#### Part3 Integration and Test
    We integrate three separate modules into a final version. Combining the objective conditions and our plan, we achieve the following functions:
    1.	The database is established based on the cloud service provided by Tencent and user login and registration is realized through cloud development.
    2.	Based on the comprehensive development of Tencent map, the positioning, ranging, optimal route planning and navigation of the charging pile are realized.
    3.	The charging reminder is realized to synchronize the charging state of the car and the charging pile.
